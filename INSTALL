INSTALL -- Instructions for compiling and installing AW2C

Makefile targets, and their prerequisite programs:

"make" 
   
   builds and tests AW2C. All sorts of stuff will scroll past. When
   you see "ALL TESTS PASSED" you will have an Algol W compiler.

   Requires Ocaml, Python, GCC and the Boehm GC library
   (apt-get install gcc libgc-dev ocaml-nox python python-docutils)

"make install" 

   Installs AW2C. The default destination is the "/usr/local'
   directories. Edit Makefile if you do not want this.

   Requires install, sed (basic Unix tools)

   I recommend reading "man aw2c" and "/usr/local/share/doc/aw2c.html"
   at this point. "man aw2c" explains how to run the thing, "aw2c.html"
   the fine points of AW2C's Algol W implementation.

"make dist"

   Creates a distribution tar file. This only works from a directory
   under the wing of the Darcs version control system.

   Requires darcs, gzip
   (apt-get install darcs)
