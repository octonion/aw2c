AW2C: an Algol W compiler

Read INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

About
-----

aw2c is a new compiler for the Algol W language. It is intended to to
be a correct and complete implementation of the language described in
the Algol W Language Description, June 1972.

aw2c uses Gnu C (with its extensions) as an intermediate language.  It
allows Algol W programs to contain inline C code and be linked to C
object code.

aw2c should be able to compile code intended for the ALGOLW and
XALGOLW compilers with little or no modification. There may be some
incompatibilities, aw2c appears to have stricter type-checking than
ALGOLW and some cunning Algol W coding work-arounds will no longer
work.

aw2c's interface to C and implementation details are described in
aw2c.rst or aw2c.html.
