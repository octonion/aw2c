.SH "NAME"
aw2c \- compiler for the Algol W language
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBalgolw\fR \fIsource.alw\fR \fIprogram\fR

\fBaw2c\fR [\fIsource.alw\fR] [\fB\-trace\fR] [\fB\-o\fR \fIobject.c\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBaw2c\fR implements the language described in \fIAlgol W
Language Description, June 1972\fR very closely. \fBaw2c\fR
allows Algol W programs to contain inline C code and to be linked
with \fBgcc\fR object code.  Read the details in the \fBaw2c\fR manual:
\fIaw2c.html\fR.
.SH "COMMANDS"
\fBalgolw\fR is the script for compiling single-source Algol W programs. 
.PP
\fBaw2c\fR compiles Algol W programs into Gnu C (with its extensions). 
.PP
If \fIsource.alw\fR is left out the Algol W source is read from the standard input.
If \fB\-o\fR \fIobject.c\fR is left out the C source is written to the standard output.
.PP
\fB\-trace\fR asks \fBaw2c\fR to insert procedure call tracing code (see \fIaw2c.html\fR.)
.PP
\fBaw2c\fR C code must be compiled with gcc and linked to the \fImath\fR, \fIBoehm GC\fR
and \fIaw2c run-time\fR libraries: \fB\-lm\fR \fB\-lgc\fR and \fB\-lalw\fR. [The \fB\-lalw\fR flag has
to appear after the object code files. I don't know why.]
.PP
    aw2c main\-program.alw \-o main.c
    aw2c separate\-procedure.alw \-o procedure.c
    gcc main.c procedure.c other\-stuff.o \-lm \-lgc \-lalw \-o program
.SH "AW2C and GCC"
\fBaw2c\fR uses Gnu C (with its extensions) as an intermediate
language.  \fBaw2c\fR is responsible for all parsing, type checking and
compile-time error messages, but it passes on the difficult task of
generating object code to \fBgcc\fR. \fBgcc\fR should stay completely invisible
when you run \fBalgolw\fR, any messages from \fBgcc\fR whatsoever should be
considered to be bugs in \fBaw2c\fR.  
.PP
Programs compiled by \fBaw2c\fR should be able to produce Algol W specific
error messages for all possible runtime errors.  A program created by
\fBaw2c\fR should never output C assertion errors or a core-dump.
(However, if you include inline C code you are back on your own.)
.SH "PREREQUISITES"
The gcc C compiler,
the Boehm GC library (\fIlibgc1c2\fR in Debian).
